# Credit-Card
# Credit Card Fraud Detection using Machine Learning is a method that involves a Data Science team investigating data and developing a model that will uncover and prevent fraudulent transactions.

# This is accomplished by combining all relevant aspects of cardholder transactions, such as Date, User Zone, Product Category, Amount, Provider, Client Behavioral Patterns, and so on. The data is then fed into a model that has been discreetly trained model that finds patterns and rules so that it can classify whether a transaction is fraudulent or is legitimate.

# The Conventional Fraud Detection: 
It takes a long time to complete. Multiple means of verification are required, which is cumbersome for the user. Only detects fraud that is evident. The decision-making procedures for determining schemes should be manually established. 

# Why Machine Learning-based Fraud Detection:

Detecting fraud automatically Real-time streaming Less time is needed for verification methods Identifying hidden correlations in data Basis For this project let’s assume you’ve been employed by a financial Institution (E.g Commercial Bank) to help Customers to be certain that they will not be charged for things they did not buy by detecting possible fraudulent activities. You’re provided with a dataset with people’s transactions and information on whether or not they’re fraudulent, and you’re expected to distinguish between them.

# Project Strategy:
The project steps are shown below. In this article,I will display short python scripts used to achieve some of the results from my analysis.
